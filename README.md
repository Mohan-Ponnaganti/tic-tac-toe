# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The game allows a human player to compete against the computer. The human plays as crosses ("X"), and the computer plays as circles ("O"). The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features
- **Player vs Computer:** The human player competes against the computer.
- **Simple AI:** The computer makes moves by choosing the last available spot on the board.
- **Winner Detection:** The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game board is displayed after each move, and the user is prompted to make their move.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. The game will display a 3x3 grid.
3. Enter a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the grid position where you want to place your "X".
4. The computer will then place an "O" in an available spot.
5. The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

### Grid Positioning:
```
 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9
```

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).

### Compilation
To compile the game, run the following command:
```sh
g++ -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp
```

### Running the Game
After compiling, run the game with:
```sh
./tictactoe
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a more advanced AI using the Minimax algorithm.
- Add support for different board sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).
- Implement a GUI version of the game.
